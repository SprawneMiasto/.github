# Sprawne Miasto
Sprawne Miasto is a platform that allows you to report problems of public infrastructure.

## About Us
We are students of the Secondary and Technical School Complex No. 1 in Warsaw, as well as great enthusiasts of programming. In our spare time, we like to get involved in helping the local community. We decided to combine our passions and create the Sprawne Miasto.
